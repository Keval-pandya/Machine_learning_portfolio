<p> Hello There, Here is my project about the housing price prediction on the boston dataset using Ridge And Lasso Regression. </p>
<p>Dataset is loaded form the library called Sklearn which is very useful library for creating machine learning models. </p>
<p> One Major reason for using the Ridge and Lasso Regression is that The data set contains too much features which leads it to overfitting so there is need to the regularization in the algortihm. Ridge and Lasso Regression use the L1 and L2 regularization to decrease the overfitting. </p>
